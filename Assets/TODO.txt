enemies spawn randomly in a range from spawnpoint

automatic firing on LMB hold PERHAPS wtih powerup?

DONE -------fix the god damn health bar rotating weirdly above the player
     -------(why did i make it worldspace surely its easier to just have it screenspace, and NOT parented to the rotation of the player)
     -------and now for some reason once every 4 restarts, the enemies healthbars are sideways???

random spawned health pickups +20 hp

PLAYER STRAFING omg why did i not add this

enemy navmesh + obstacles, instead of just LOOK AT PLAYER. GO TO PLAYER

stop enemy spawning after death

fix weird health bar offset when on 20 health (how is this even a thing)

add an exit button

remove enemy spawner (debug tool, press E to spawn enemy)
